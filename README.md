# Building a Chat Application in Golang, Fiber, PostgreSQL, Redis and  ReactJS

## Achievements

- [x] Create a basic frontend to host my services
- [x] Create a chat app service using Websocket
- [x] Create JWT Auhentication service
- [x] Everything is dockerized

## Issues

- If JWT Token is valid, user gets redirected to /home, the problem is the user itself doesnt get picked up by the frontend, so the user is not logged in. I need to find a way to pass the user to the frontend.

## Todo

- Create a video chat app service using WebRTC
- Make the services scalable
