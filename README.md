# Building a Chat Application in Go with ReactJS

## Achievements

- [x] Create a basic frontend to host my services
- [x] Create a chat app service using Websocket
- [x] Create a video chat app service using WebRTC
- [x] Create an authentication service using Redis

## Issues

- If JWT Token is valid, user gets redirected to /home, the problem is the user itself doesnt get picked up by the frontend, so the user is not logged in. I need to find a way to pass the user to the frontend.

## Todo

- Deploy the services to a cloud provider
- Make the services scalable
- Change Redis db to a more suitable/reliable db
